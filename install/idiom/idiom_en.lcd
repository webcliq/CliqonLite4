$istr[51] = 'We dislike web systems that will not function unless every step of the Install process has been carried out by the install function. There is always something that can go wrong with a fully automated process. All the Steps of the Cliqon Lite installation process could be performed manually and this install procedure is a guide to that procedure.'; 

$istr[52] = 'You will unzip the files of the Cliqon Lite system and copy them to the Directory and Domain of your choice.';

$istr[53] = 'The original compressed file contains certain important but initially empty Directories - these are: <strong>/tmp, /cache</strong> and <strong>/data</strong>. If for some reason the copying procedure does not allow for the copying of empty directories, these must be created.';

$istr[54] = 'The following Directories must be set to be writeable (permanently) - <strong>/tmp and /cache</strong>. If you intend to use SQLite then it is presumed that the database text file will be stored and in <strong>/data</strong> and if so, that must be writeable as well. ';

$istr[55] = 'Configuration files are stored in <strong>/config</strong> and depending on the nature of the system, the directories to which files and images will be uploaded, such as <strong>views/gallery</strong> will need to be writeable as well.';

$istr[56] = 'The main configuration file <strong>config/config.php</strong> contains all the fundamental settings for a Cliqon Lite System. To ensure that the install process runs the first time the system is accessed, a Config file does not exist and is created by copying from the Install Directory. Press the button to create an initial Config file.';

$istr[57] = 'On the form below, we tell the Cliqon system three things: The Database details including the name and type of server, database and the user credentials to access the database. Which languages will be used by the system and finally the initial administrator name and password to access the system. For full details of the Configuration file, please see the Cliqon Lite Manual which is accessible on the web at <a href="http://manual.cliqon.com" target="_blank">manual.cliqon.com</a>';

$istr[59] = 'If this is a multi-lingual system, please create entries for the two character language code and associated Language names and flag or other language orientated image.

This is the normal mechanism used throughout Cliqon for string to array definitions.';

This ensures that the system can support a number of Server types, is very secure and is very easy to work with when design new modules. Please visit <a href="http://RedbeanPHP.Com/" target="_blank">RedbeanPHP.Com</a> for more information.';

$istr[61] = 'There are many advantages to using an ORM and one of them is the ease by which the Tables are created. Cliqon has a data dictionary file - <strong>\config\table_setup.php</strong> in which the tables and fields are defined. Press the button below and the creation of the tables will be confirmed or error information will be displayed.';

$istr[62] = 'In the \data directory are a series of SQL import files to setup the initial data of the system. As Cliqon Lite is a multi-lingual system, there is a base file and then a series of language specific files. The installation process will attempt to import a language specific SQL file for each language that you have defined in the Config file. If a SQL file does not exist for the configured language, the English file will be imported and you can then use the Administrative functions to translate the strings for that language.';

$istr[63] = 'The installation process does not create Administrative Users in the Database, only in the Configuration file. You should access the Admin facility to create these users. We have noted that language translations may need to be created. Please now read the Manual to understand how Cliqon Lite works and what you can do with it.';
